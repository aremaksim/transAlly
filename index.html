        </div>
        <p class="type-out">This is how this page works:<br><br> People can make suggestions for doctors that were transfriendly and experienced in working with trans people and knowing and understanding the needs of trans people. Once a suggestion for a source has been voted for a minimum of 3 times it will appear on the listings. Everyone can vote up or down for a source someone has shared.
            This way I want to make sure that no source can be posted without being double checked and verified by at least 2 other queers. The goal is to provide information on where to go as a trans person in need and long term to create a database in the from of an API so other health care organisations can make use of our carefully curated database and spread this essential information to other people in need.
             <br><br>There is also a section for recommended books by our community. Go and have a <a href="books.html">look</a> and if you like also vote if you like or dislike a suggestion. These entries won't be deleted.<br><br>
